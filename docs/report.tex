% Example abstract:
In every economy there exist many factors impacting long-term equilibria, some of which have been accounted for by various models. 
Here, we examine the differences between the Goodwin and Goodwin-Keen models which seek to explain economic dynamics. To do so, we present long-term equilibria and conduct a brief sensitivity study. The results illustrate that the Goodwin model presents only one realistic equilibrium, that the Goodwin-Keen model's non-trivial solution is an extreme economic scenario, and that the long-term economic equilibria are impacted by the initial state variable conditions. These findings motivate the pursuit of a deeper understanding of economic dynamics, as it paves the way for better predictions of economic events.

\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
% Introduction Paragragh
Time series analysis has many applications across various industries. With the advancement of technology and ease of access to data, there has been increased investment in end-to-end quantitative and machine learning models that are used to exploit inefficiencies in financial markets \citep{coqueret2021machine}. The purpose of this project will be to analyze historic stock market performance in the US market in order to predict near future performance\footnote{A stock market index is calculated as the weighted average of a basket of stocks.}. The S\&P 500 is used to represent the market performance in the United States for the purpose of this study. 

% Body Paragraph
Using historical data to predict the future performance of the index is based on the assumption that stock prices are derived from market forces and historical trends \citep{levy1967relative}. Although this theory was challenged by the \textit{Efficient Market Hypothesis} proposed by \citet{emh} which states that stock prices follow a random walk and; therefore, cannot be predicted by past prices, many empirical studies have found that stock prices are predictable \citep{malkiel2003efficient}.

% Closing Paragraph
For time series forecasting, there are various techniques that can be applied. In this study, an ARIMA model along with various transformations will be considered to adjust the time series such that it is approximately stationary. This report will conclude by forecasting values of the index based on the fitted model and remarks are made based on the value of this model as a potential, real-world, predictive tool.

\section{Methodology} \label{methodology}

\texttt{R} \citep{R} was used to aggregate market data and fit the model\footnote{The \texttt{R} commands can be viewed in the \nameref{appendix} and the entire project can be viewed on \href{https://github.com/grantwforsythe/ARIMA-Model}{GitHub}.}.  In this research, the Adjusted Open Price\footnote{Adjusted Open Price is calculated after dividends, stock splits and other factors.} is used as a representation of stock indices data. The nomenclature follows \citet{cryer2008time}.

\subsection{MA Model}
A moving average process is a finite weighted sum of past random errors plus current random error. A moving average of order $q$, denoted as MA($q$), is defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MA}
    Y_t = e_t - \theta_1e_{t-1} - \theta_2e_{t-2} - \cdots - \beta_pe_{t-q}.
\end{equation}
A strong assumption for MA models is that the time-series is \textit{stationary}, .i.e. the variance and autocorrelation structure do not change with time. 

\subsection{AR Model}
%An Autoregressive model, as the name suggests, is a regression of itself.% 
In an autoregressive model, the value at time $t$ is regressed on the previous value(s) from that same time series. A $p^{\text{th}}$ order autoregressive model, denoted as AR$(p)$, is described by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AR}
    \centering
    Y_t = \phi_1Y_{t-1} + \phi_2Y_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_pY_{t-p} + e_t.
\end{equation} 
Like an MA model, AR models require the strict same assumptions of stationarity.

\subsection{ARIMA Model}

Unlike the aforementioned models, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average - abbreviated as ARIMA - models can be applied to a non-stationary time series. ARIMA models are the aggregate of \eqref{eq:MA}, \eqref{eq:AR}, and the number differences required to make the series approximately stationary\footnote{Differencing can help stabilize the mean and reduce trends such that the time series has relatively constant variance.}. It takes the linear function of past observations and random error terms to obtain the predicted future value of a predictor.The model is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ARIMA}
        W_t = \phi_1W_{t-1} + \phi_2W_{t-2} + \cdots + \beta_pW_{t-p} + e_t - \theta_1e_{t-1} - \theta_2e_{t-2} - \cdots - \theta_qe_{t-q}. 
\end{equation}

\section{Application} \label{application}

\subsection{Model Specification}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:USA_open} the plot shows a clear upward trend. The variance also tends to be relatively stable with the exception of a few dips.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{imgs/USA_open.png}
    \caption{S\&P500 Performance.}
    \label{fig:USA_open}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:acf&pacf}, the autocorrelation function shows that the present value of the series is strongly related to its past values since all lags pictured are significantly out of the confidence band. A transformation needs to be performed on the data in order to meet the stationarity assumption.

\end{table}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:first_difference}, the first difference is close to having mean zero, and the variance is relatively constant. This suggests that the first difference is a good transformation for this data series as it looks approximately stationary. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{imgs/first_difference.png}
    \caption{The First Difference of the S\&P500.}
    \label{fig:first_difference}
\end{figure}

As Figure \ref{fig:second_difference} shows, the distribution for the second difference is very similar to the first difference. By parsimony, the best model is the simplest possible model, the first difference is preferred.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{imgs/second_difference.png}
    \caption{The Second Difference of the S\&P500.}
    \label{fig:second_difference}
\end{figure}

As Figure \ref{fig:acf&pacf_diff} shows, the autocorrelation coefficients are significant at lag 5, lag 9, and lag 18. The autocorrelation function does not seem to converge to zero as the number of lags increase.

% It is known that the Goodwin model suffers from many limitations \citep{harvie2000testing, moura2013testing}. Nevertheless, the model has persisted. The Goodwin model supplies economists with insight into the prey-predator relationships between capitalists and workers \citep{goodwin1982growth}. We have concluded from our study that this model only has one economically realistic equilibrium. More importantly, this equilibrium can only be divergent (but economically unfeasible) or oscillatory. This feature has been heavily criticized since, in reality, economies are liable to failures. The Goodwin model does not consider such a scenario, as it does not describe the economy in sufficient detail. However, what it does offer is a concise formulation and a stepping-stone for more complex and accurate models.

% Such is the case for the Goodwin-Keen model. What Steve Keen accomplished was the persistence of the prey-predator nature of the original model with the possibility of exhibiting an economic failure scenario \citep{keen1995finance}. Here, $(\lambda^\times, \omega^\times, d^\times)$ represents this critical contribution to the overall model. Unlike with the Goodwin model, where the trivial solution holds no economic value, the divergent solution for the Goodwin-Keen model describes the real scenario of an economy with maximum debt, absolute unemployment, and no wage share for the working population \citep{minsky1992financial}. Our simulation study also shows that \emph{ceteris paribus}, the nature of the long-term equilibrium of the economy, is dependent on the initial conditions of the state variables $\lambda$, $\omega$, and $d$. That is, economies described by the same parameters can fail or stabilize solely as a result of where they begin.

% \section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
% Throughout this report, the Goodwin and Goodwin-Keen models have been described qualitatively, and presented mathematically. The behaviours of the economic models have been explored numerically and analytically. The tendency of the Goodwin model to converge to an oscillatory equilibrium state or diverge has been demonstrated. The Goodwin-Keen model, which can show more realistic features representative of an economic collapse, has been investigated, and simulations have been performed. A thorough comparison of the models has interpreted their behaviours. This study has concluded that the Goodwin model produces unrealistic long-term behaviour that cannot be used to accurately describe an economy. It has, however, led to many more economically representative models based on the original prey-predator dynamic, such as the Goodwin-Keen model. As demonstrated in this report, Keen's improved model can reasonably simulate an economic crash (instability). The ability to simulate and predict an incoming economic crash, such as a recession or depression, gives governments invaluable foresight. This may allow policy-makers to enact regulations for avoiding, or at the very least, curbing the severity of the crash. Our findings motivate the pursuit of a deeper understanding of economic dynamics, as it paves the way for better predictions of economic events.
